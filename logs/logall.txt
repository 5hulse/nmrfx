1510663141 Update to 10.1.16

NEW	gui	Update the Help menu to add menu items for showing the latest available version and for opening a browser window to the Google Group mailing list site.

1510416984 Update to 10.1.15

IMPROVE	gui	Pick peaks in the whole window if no crosshairs are present.

NEW	gui	Peaks are now saved and loaded in a new format, .xpk2.  This format is an update to the old .xpk format that makes it easier to read without requiring Tcl code.  The latest version of NMRViewJ (9.2.b16) now supports reading these files so picked peaks can be moved from NMRFx Processor to Viewer (NMRViewJ).

IMPROVE	gui	Full control of selecting peak lists for display is not yet ready, but if you click the ShowPeaks checkbox on/off it will scan for available peak lists that match the current dataset. 


BUG	gui	Fix line extending back to origin in PDF and SVG plots of 1D spectra, wasn't using count of number of valid points.

IMPROVE	gui	Redo 1d drawing to use scale and (newly added) offset values, rather than using changes in YAxis scale

IMPROVE	gui	Change Peak Pick (from Icon) to allow it to work like picking from NvJ spectrum menu (whether to append or replace depends on whether there are peaks within current region).  If crosshairs present then picking happens within region.

NEW	gui	Add menu items for peak fitting and tweaking.

NEW	cmd	Add code for shifting peaks (tweak) to the nearest maximum (within foot print). 

IMPROVE	cmd	Add and improve existing  methods for fitting and shifting peaks.

IMPROVE	gui	Start adding more entries (like View) to spectrum popup-menu

BUG	 gui	AutoLevel was being called when loading a dataset that has a level

NEW	gui	Add ability to load and write lists of operations.  Menu items are available in the Script menu.  Operation lists should not be considered executable python scripts.  Rather they are text files that contain a list of operations that will be added to the existing operation list.  Loading operations is useful both for importing a set of operations for a particular dataset and for using with (and generating) simulated data.

IMPROVE	gui	Add SCRIPT to list in OperationInfo (so it shows in menu)

IMPROVE	cmd	Add execFileName argument to SCRIPT.  Change script and initalScript types to wstring (waits to update operation till Enter hit in GUI)

BUG	cmd	Extract wasn't working with simulated fids (not tied to a dataset)

IMPROVE	gui	Add overlay method and menu item.  This allows one to switch the spectrum display from a grid to an overlay of all the spectra (and one can switch back with Grid item)

IMPROVE	gui	When doing spectrum alignment use temporary peakLists just for alignment (so as not to change any existing lists)

BUG	gui	Alignment was failing sometimes because peaklists were deleted too soon.

IMPROVE	gui	Add code (and menu items in Spectrum menu) for minimizing axis display (allow only showing axis labels etc. on border windows (left and bottom edges)

IMPROVE	gui	Allow specifying datasets to display on command line when starting up NMRFx Processor from the shell.

IMPROVE	cmd	Add simple jython to R interface

BUG	gui	Spinner and plane listeners weren't getting set properly for 4D

BUG	gui	Axis change listener was always using dim 2 for planes

BUG	gui	PDF export was using moveTo not lineTo for polyline

BUG	cmd	Fix display of Process status for 4D to allow processing 4D spectra.

BUG	cmd	Generating script wasn't getting NUS DIM right for 4D

1501540130 Update to 10.1.9
